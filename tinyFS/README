Testing indicates the file system and all of the functions are working.

Additional Features:
   -Upon mount, the TinyFS is checked for integrity.
      The superblock, root inode block, and all magic numbers are checked
      Returns CORRUPT_FS if any block is in incorrect format
   -Files are given timestamps (created, modified, and accessed)
      This can be printed using tfs_readFileInfo()
   -Calling tfs_readdir() will print the root node and all files within it

Limitations:
   -Max number of files one can create (244)
   -Max number of disks, and the number of blocks (256)
      -Subsequently, max disk size of 65536 bytes
   -File names also have a limit of 8 characters, any additional
     characters will be truncated.
   -Max number of free blocks (254)
